  <h2>Method - What website did you study? Who is the target audience? What three tasks did you assign to your subjects?</h2>
  <p>The website I studied was my portfolio. The target audience is anyone who wants to look at my portfolio and what I've done. It is also students my age who want to take a look at my portfolio. I assigned the subjects to search for a button, use the javascript to make a video play faster, and to find an image in the portfolio.</p>
  <h2>Results - Were subjects able to complete the tasks you assigned them? Was it easy for them? How much time, or how many steps, did it take to complete the tasks?</h2>
  <p>The subjects were able to complete most of the tasks I assigned. One student, however, could not find a button in the navigation bar. The scavenger hunt was fairly easy, but not easy enough that everything was on one page. The steps were to try to find things using the navigation bar and use anything on that page to complete the task. It only took 3 steps at most to complete a task.</p>
  <h2>Discussion - What did you learn from this study about the website? Is the current design effective? Why or why not? How might the site be designed differently so that users could more easily perform the representative tasks?</h2>
  <p>I learned that evaluation from others is very important in improving your website. The current design is effective and does not contain many issues. However, there are issues with some of the javascript. I think it was effective because the design made it look more modern. The site can be designed differently so subjects can more easily complete the tasks if I give better page navigation not only in the navigation bar, but in each individual page as well.</p>
