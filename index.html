		<h2>Unit 2</h2>
		<p>In unit 2, I learned to collaborate with my teammates, to find strengths and weaknesses, and to do different things based on the strengths and weaknesses. I also learned how to use different things to add in coding such as links and data tables.</p>
		
		<h2>Unit 3</h2>
		<p>In this unit, I learned many different to use CSS. I learned what different elements such as margin, color, text, etc. I also learned how to apply styling to specific parts of a page instead of the entire page altogether. Now I know how to identify not only paragraphs and to style them, but now I know how to style a certain paragraph using ID or CLASS.</p>
		
		<h2>Unit 4</h2>

   		 alt="Camera"/>
       <p>Unit 4 has taught me multiple things. For example, I learned the purpose of a banner as well as how to make one. I learned how to make working buttons and place them on a page. I also learned how to create a favicon and integrate it onto my page. Now, I also know how to transfer css from one page to another and add more aspects to pages.
       </p>

		<h2>Unit 5</h2>
		<p>During this unit, I've learned how to use javascript, and the meaning behind it. I learned that functions are extremely important, but not to overpower the content on the page with it. I also learned the difference between client side and server side scripting, debugging, using functions, and I also learned how to create variables, as well as how to show/hide objects.</p>
		
		<h2>Unit 6</h2>
		<p>Throughout this unit, I learned how to validate my CSS, accessibility, and HTML overall. I also learned how to test usablity and fix things based on feedback.</p>
		<p>A list of what I learned:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Validating code</li>
				<li>Conducting a usability test</li>
				<li>Fixing problems based on feedback</li>
			</ul>
